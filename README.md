# BisSeq
BisSeq: A RRBS simulating and analyzing pipeline

## What this pipeline can do?
BisSeq is a pipeline integrating the simulation and data analyzing of RRBS in a batch style. User can plug in different RRBS profiling software into BisSeq. In this repo, the scripts benchmarking [Bismark](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/), [BSseeker2](http://pellegrini.mcdb.ucla.edu/BS_Seeker2/), [BSMAP](https://sites.google.com/a/brown.edu/bioinformatics-in-biomed/bsmap-for-methylation) are provided. Using the provided scripts as template, users can easily develop customized pipeline for their own research purpose. Read the in-line comments to configure parameters and to have a better understanding of how the pipeline work.
